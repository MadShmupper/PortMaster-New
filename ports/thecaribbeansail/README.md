# Notes

Thanks to [Victorian Clambake](https://victorian-clambake.itch.io) for creating this fantastic game, which you can purchase at [itch.io](https://victorian-clambake.itch.io/the-caribbean-sail). The Steam version works, too.

It's probably easiest to skip renaming the crew, but if you must, see the text entry details below under **Controls** (below).

Working with version: `The Caribbean Sail - V1.7.1.6.zip`, *Jan 01, 2024*


## Controls

| Button  | Action |
| ------- | ------ |
| L-STICK | Mouse  |
| A/R1    | Click  |
| SELECT  | Menu   |

For text entry (for names, etc.) --

1. Enter text-input mode using: `START + DPAD-DOWN`
2. Once activated, use `DPAD-UP/DOWN` to select letters, and `DPAD-LEFT/RIGHT` to move a letter back/forward
3. Use `A` for `ENTER` (when you're done)

In some instances, you may need to press `START` to confirm and exit interactive text entry; `SELECT/HOTKEY` cancels interactive text entry.
